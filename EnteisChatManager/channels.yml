# This is the Chat Channels configuration file.
# You can edit the existing channel prefixes to your liking.
# The 'channelType' setting depicts whether or not the lists below the prefixes are used.
# Setting it to 'List' will enable the lists, but will disable the permissions that decide which player can see what.
# Setting it to 'Permission' will enable the permissions, but will disable the lists.
# Using the 'List' option is ideal for a whitelisted server.
